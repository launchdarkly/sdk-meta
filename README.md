## structure

This repo is essentially a JSON database hosted on Github. 

The "tables" live in [`data`](./data) and the schemas for those tables live in [`schemas`](./schemas). When adding
a new table, ensure it has a corresponding schema.

Data can be validated against the schemas using `./scripts/ci/check-json-schemas.sh` on Linux.

Ensure that the JSON files are valid and formatted using `./scripts/ci/format-json.sh`.

Finally, it's important that each SDK listed in `sdks.json` has a corresponding entry in each table, as this is
what downstream tools will expect. 

This is enforced with `./scripts/ci/sdk-consistency.sh`.
